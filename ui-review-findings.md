## üìä Executive Summary

### üö® Critical Issues Identified

1. **Server Connectivity Problems**
   - **Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL
   - **Issue:** Server becomes unresponsive during extended testing
   - **Impact:** Prevents comprehensive UI testing and user access
   - **Evidence:** Connection timeouts, stuck processes, unresponsive endpoints

2. **Environment Configuration Issues**
   - **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH
   - **Issue:** Missing or incomplete environment variables for testing
   - **Impact:** Tests fail due to environment validation errors
   - **Evidence:** Env validation failures, missing CLERK_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE keys

---

## üîç Server-Side Analysis

### Server Startup Behavior
- ‚úÖ **Initial Startup:** Server starts successfully on port 3001
- ‚úÖ **Environment Loading:** Loads .env.local and .env files
- ‚úÖ **Next.js Compilation:** Compiles successfully (1659ms, 1005 modules)
- ‚ùå **Sustained Operation:** Server becomes unresponsive under load

### Identified Server Issues

#### 1. Process Hanging
```bash
# Server process becomes stuck in CLOSE_WAIT state
COMMAND   PID          USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node    38889 girishpastula   19u  IPv6 ... TCP localhost:redwood-broker->localhost:57710 (CLOSE_WAIT)
```

#### 2. Connection Timeouts
- **Symptoms:** 30-second timeouts on page loads
- **Affected Endpoints:** All pages including /sign-in
- **Error Pattern:** `page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded`

#### 3. Environment Dependencies
- **Required for Testing:** E2E_TESTING=true, TESTING=true
- **Missing Variables:** CLERK_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
- **Impact:** Prevents proper test environment initialization

## üìã Page Accessibility Analysis

Based on the attempted testing, here's the accessibility status:

### üî¥ Currently Inaccessible Pages
- `/sign-in` - Connection timeout
- `/dashboard` - Server unresponsive
- `/dashboard/patients` - Cannot reach
- `/dashboard/appointments` - Cannot reach
- `/dashboard/sso-management` - Cannot reach
- All other dashboard pages - Untestable due to server issues

### üü° Partially Accessible
- **Server Start Page:** Loads initially but becomes unresponsive
- **Static Assets:** May load but dynamic content fails

---

## üîß Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Server Stability Issues
```bash
# Investigate server hanging
- Check memory usage during operation
- Monitor for memory leaks in Next.js app
- Review connection pooling settings
- Analyze process termination handling
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Set up proper test environment
export E2E_TESTING=true
export TESTING=true
export NODE_ENV=test
export CLERK_SECRET_KEY="test_key_placeholder"
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="test_sk_placeholder" 
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="test_whsec_placeholder"
```

### 3. Connection Pool Management
```javascript
// Implement proper connection cleanup
// Add connection timeout settings
// Review database connection limits
```
