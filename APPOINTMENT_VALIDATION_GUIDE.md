## Browser Console Validation

Open browser DevTools (F12) and check console:

### Expected Behavior
- No critical errors
- May see API errors (expected - no backend yet):
  ```
  GET /api/appointments 404
  GET /api/doctors 404
  ```
- These are normal - UI uses mock data

### Check Network Tab
- Page loads without blocking errors
- Static assets load successfully
- No CORS errors

## Responsive Design Check

### Desktop (1920x1080)
- [ ] Full calendar visible
- [ ] All 7 days shown in week view
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling needed

### Tablet (768px)
- [ ] Calendar has horizontal scroll
- [ ] Statistics cards stack (2x2)
- [ ] Dialogs remain centered

### Mobile (375px)
- [ ] Day view recommended
- [ ] Statistics cards stack vertically
- [ ] Booking dialog full screen

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Redirected to Sign-In
**Solution**: This is expected. The app requires authentication. You can:
1. Set up Clerk auth with your keys
2. Or view the UI by checking the component files directly

### Issue: No Appointments Visible
**Solution**: Mock appointments are set for today. Check:
- Current date matches mock data
- Look for appointments at 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM

### Issue: Drag-and-Drop Not Working
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure you're dragging a booked appointment (gray slot)
2. Drop on an available slot (green)
3. Try in Chrome/Edge (best support)

### Issue: Notifications Not Sending
**Solution**: This is normal - actual SMS/WhatsApp requires:
- Backend API implementation
- SMS gateway integration (Twilio, etc.)
- WhatsApp Business API

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful if:

1. ‚úÖ **Calendar displays** with time slots and days
2. ‚úÖ **Booking dialog** opens and accepts input
3. ‚úÖ **Appointments appear** on calendar after booking
4. ‚úÖ **Drag-and-drop** moves appointments
5. ‚úÖ **Filters** update the calendar view
6. ‚úÖ **Navigation** moves between weeks/days
7. ‚úÖ **Statistics** show appointment counts
8. ‚úÖ **Notifications** preferences can be selected

## Quick Demo Script

```bash
# 1. Start the server
PORT=3002 npm run dev

# 2. Open browser
open http://localhost:3002/dashboard/appointments

# 3. If you see sign-in page, the routing is working correctly
# 4. Check the component file directly to see the implementation:
cat src/components/appointments/AppointmentScheduler.tsx
```

## Test the Implementation Quality

### Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Type checking
npm run check-types

# Linting
npm run lint

# Run the E2E tests (will skip due to auth)
PORT=3002 npx playwright test appointment-scheduling.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

## Video Demo Steps

If recording a demo:
1. Show the calendar page loading
2. Click through week/day views
3. Open a booking dialog
4. Fill the form and book
5. Show the new appointment on calendar
6. Drag an appointment to reschedule
7. Apply filters to show filtering works
8. Navigate with Previous/Next/Today buttons
