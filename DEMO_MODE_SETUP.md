# ðŸš€ Demo Mode Setup for Patient Registration

## Quick Start - Run in Demo Mode

### 1. Start Server with Demo Mode
```bash
DEMO_MODE=true npm run dev
```

### 2. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Patient List**: http://localhost:3002/dashboard/patients
- **New Patient Form**: http://localhost:3002/dashboard/patients/new
- **Patient Details**: http://localhost:3002/dashboard/patients/test-patient-id

## What's Working in the UI

### âœ… Patient List Page (`/dashboard/patients`)
- **Register Patient** button in header
- Patient table with sample data
- Search functionality (UI only)
- Statistics cards showing:
  - Total Patients
  - Outpatients
  - New Today
  - Emergency Cases
- Clickable rows for navigation

### âœ… Patient Registration Form (`/dashboard/patients/new`)
- **Personal Information**
  - First Name, Last Name
  - Date of Birth picker
  - Gender selection
  - Blood Group selection

- **Identification**
  - Aadhaar Number (12 digits validation)
  - ABHA ID

- **Contact Information**
  - Phone Number (10 digits validation)
  - Email
  - Address

- **Emergency Contact**
  - Contact Name
  - Contact Number
  - Relationship

- **Form Actions**
  - Cancel button (returns to patient list)
  - Register Patient button

### âœ… Patient Details Page (`/dashboard/patients/[id]`)
- **Three Tabs**:
  1. **Demographics Tab**

     - Contact Details
     - Emergency Contact
  
  2. **Medical History Tab**

  3. **Recent Visits Tab**
     - Visit history table

## Known Limitations

### API Endpoints
The API endpoints are not fully implemented for demo mode. You'll see these errors in the console:
- `GET /api/patients/statistics 500` - Statistics API needs demo implementation
- `GET /api/analytics/today 500` - Analytics API needs demo implementation
- `POST /api/patients` - Will return success but won't persist data

### Authentication
- The application requires Clerk authentication
- In demo mode, you might be redirected to sign-in
- API calls will fail without proper auth setup

## Validation Testing

### Form Validation Tests
1. **Phone Number Validation**
   - Enter: "12345" â†’ Should show "Phone number must be 10 digits"
   - Enter: "9876543210" â†’ Should accept

2. **Aadhaar Validation**
   - Enter: "1234" â†’ Should show "Aadhaar number must be 12 digits"
   - Enter: "123456789012" â†’ Should accept

3. **Required Fields**
   - Try submitting empty form â†’ Should show required field errors
   - Fill all required fields â†’ Should allow submission

## Visual Validation Checklist

### Patient Registration Form
- [ ] Form card layout with sections
- [ ] Date picker for DOB
- [ ] Dropdown for Gender (Male/Female/Other)
- [ ] Dropdown for Blood Group (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-)
- [ ] Text areas for address
- [ ] Validation messages appear in red
- [ ] Submit and Cancel buttons at bottom

### Patient List
- [ ] Table with columns: Patient ID, Name, Age/Gender, Contact, Blood Group, Last Visit, Status
- [ ] Search bar at top
- [ ] Status filter dropdown
- [ ] Pagination controls at bottom
- [ ] "Register Patient" button in header

### Patient Details
- [ ] Patient name as header
- [ ] Edit Patient and Schedule Appointment buttons

## Development Tips

### To See the Pages Without Authentication
If you're getting redirected to sign-in, you can:
1. Set up Clerk authentication with your keys
2. Or modify the middleware temporarily to bypass auth for development

### To Add Mock Data
The components are using mock data defined in:
- `PatientDetails.tsx` - mockPatient object
- API routes would need similar mock data

### To Connect Real API
1. Implement the `/api/patients` endpoints
2. Connect to your database using Drizzle ORM
3. Update the form submission to handle real responses
4. Implement search and filter functionality

## Success Metrics

The implementation is successful if you can:
1. âœ… Navigate to all three pages
2. âœ… See the form with all fields
3. âœ… See validation errors for invalid input
4. âœ… Click between pages using navigation
5. âœ… View the tabbed patient details layout
