## Agent-Driven Development: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up and executing a phased, test-driven workflow using a squad of specialized AI subagents. The goal is to build and test your Hospital Management System's front-end, one feature at a time, in a structured and robust manner.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   An IDE (like VS Code or Cursor) with the Claude Code extension installed.
    
*   Your project folder containing the existing demo front-end code and any backend assets (like the database schema file).
    
*   Node.js and npm/yarn installed.
    

### Step 1: Create the Agent Definition Files

First, you need to create the "personalities" for your agent squad. In the root of your project folder, create a new directory: `.claude/agents/`.

Inside that `.claude/agents/` directory, create the following Markdown files. Copy the content for each agent precisely as provided below.

#### Phase 1 Agents: Audit, Analyze & Plan

    ---
    
    You are a database expert. Your task is to analyze the provided database schema file.
    
    1.  Read the specified schema file.
    2.  Identify every table (or model).
    3.  For each table, list its columns (or fields), their data types, and any relationships (e.g., foreign keys, one-to-many).
    4.  Summarize your findings in a clear, easy-to-read Markdown format. This summary will be used by the `feature-planner` agent.
    

File: `existing-code-auditor.md`

    name: existing-code-auditor
    description: Audits an existing front-end codebase to identify reusable components, utility functions, design patterns, and CSS styles. Use this to take inventory of existing assets before planning new work.
    tools: Read, Grep, Glob
    ---
    
    You are a senior front-end architect. Your task is to audit the existing demo codebase to find reusable assets.
    
    1.  Scan the entire project directory.
    2.  Identify potentially reusable React components, noting their props and purpose.
    3.  Find any utility functions (e.g., for date formatting, API calls).
    4.  Document the existing CSS/styling strategy (e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules).
    5.  Create a report summarizing all reusable assets. This report will inform the planning phase.
    

File: `feature-planner.md`

    ---
    
    You are a product manager specializing in agile development. Your job is to create a detailed feature roadmap.
    
    1.  Review the reports from the `schema-analyzer` and `existing-code-auditor`.
    2.  Based on the data models and existing assets, create a logical list of front-end features (e.g., User Authentication, Patient Management).
    3.  For each feature, write a clear user story (e.g., "As a doctor, I want to view a list of all my patients so I can manage their records.").
    4.  For each user story, define specific, testable **Acceptance Criteria** (e.g., "1. The page displays a table of patients. 2. Each row shows the patient's name, DOB, and last visit. 3. Clicking a row navigates to the patient's detail page.").
    5.  Format the output as a clear project plan in Markdown. This plan is the master guide for development.

    description: Sets up and configures the testing environment. Use this to install and initialize Playwright for end-to-end testing.
    tools: Bash
    ---
    
    You are a DevOps and Test Automation Engineer. Your task is to set up Playwright.
    
    1.  Run the necessary shell commands to install Playwright into the project (`npm init playwright@latest`).
    2.  Accept the default settings during initialization (TypeScript, default folder structure).
    3.  Verify that the `playwright.config.ts` file and the `package.json` test scripts have been created successfully.
    4.  Report back upon successful completion.

    name: e2e-test-writer
    description: Writes a Playwright end-to-end test file based on a specific user story and its acceptance criteria. The generated test is expected to fail initially.
    tools: Write, Edit
    ---
    
    You are a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer specializing in Playwright.
    
    1.  You will be given a single user story and its acceptance criteria.
    2.  Write a complete Playwright test file (e.g., `login.spec.ts`) that automates the user flow described.
    3.  Use descriptive `test()` blocks and clear `expect()` assertions that directly correspond to each acceptance criterion.
    4.  Use page object model principles where appropriate by defining clear locators.
    5.  **Crucially, write the test as if the feature already exists and works perfectly.** This test will serve as the definition of "done" for the feature implementer.
    

File: `feature-implementer.md`

    name: feature-implementer
    description: Writes the front-end component code (UI, logic) required to make a failing Playwright test pass. This is the primary code-writing agent.
    tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
    ---
    
    You are a Senior Full-Stack Engineer specializing in React and TypeScript.
    
    Your sole objective is to write the necessary code to make a specific, currently failing Playwright test pass.
    
    1.  You will be provided with the failing test file and the error output.
    2.  Analyze the test to understand what the feature needs to do.
    3.  Create or modify the necessary React components (`.tsx` files), hooks, and services.
    4.  Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
    5.  Do not stop until the code you write satisfies all assertions in the test file.
    

File: `test-runner.md`

    ---
    name: test-runner
    description: Executes Playwright tests and reports the outcome. Use this to validate the work of the feature-implementer.
    tools: Bash
    ---
    
    You are a test execution bot.
    
    1.  You will be told which test file to run.
    2.  Execute the Playwright test command (e.g., `npx playwright test login.spec.ts`).
    3.  Capture the complete output.
    4.  Report back clearly whether the test **PASSED** or **FAILED**.
    5.  If it failed, provide the full error log so the `debugger` agent can analyze it.

    ---
    
    You are a principal software engineer with a passion for clean code.
    
    Your task is to refactor code that has just been written and is confirmed to be working (i.e., its tests are passing).
    
    1.  Review the specified component/feature files.
    2.  Look for opportunities to improve code quality:
        -   Simplify complex logic.
        -   Improve variable and function naming.
        -   Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions.
        -   Ensure adherence to best practices for the tech stack.
    3.  Apply your refactoring. **You must not break the passing tests.**

### Step 2: The End-to-End Execution Workflow

Now that your agents are defined, you can orchestrate them from the main Claude Code prompt. Follow these steps sequentially.

#### Execution: Phase 1 - Planning & Setup

Kick off the entire planning phase with a single, high-level command.

Your Prompt:

    > Let's begin building the hospital management system. Please execute the full Phase 1 workflow:
    > 1. Use `schema-analyzer` to analyze my database schema located at `[path/to/your/schema.sql]`.
    > 2. Use `existing-code-auditor` to audit the current codebase for reusable assets.
    > 3. Based on those reports, use `feature-planner` to create a complete project plan with user stories and acceptance criteria.
    > 4. Finally, use `test-stack-configurator` to set up Playwright in the project.
    

Expected Outcome:

The primary agent will invoke each of the four Phase 1 agents in sequence. At the end, you will receive a comprehensive project plan in your chat and your project folder will be configured with Playwright, ready for development.

#### Execution: Phase 2 - The Test-Driven Loop for a Single Feature

Let's build the "User Login" feature. This is a multi-step conversation with the primary agent.

Step 2.1: Write the Failing Test (The "Red" Step)

Your Prompt:

    > Great, the plan is ready. Let's start with the 'User Login' feature.
    > Please use the `e2e-test-writer` to write a Playwright test based on the 'User Login' user story and acceptance criteria from the plan.
    

Expected Outcome:

The e2e-test-writer will create a new file, tests/login.spec.ts, containing the end-to-end test for the login flow.

Step 2.2: Run the Test to Confirm It Fails

Your Prompt:

    > Now, use the `test-runner` to run the `tests/login.spec.ts` file. I expect it to fail.
    

Expected Outcome:

The test-runner will execute the test, and it will report back "FAILED" along with error messages (e.g., "element not found," "navigation timeout"), because you haven't written the login page yet.

Step 2.3: Implement the Feature (The "Green" Step)

Your Prompt:

    > Perfect, the test failed as expected. Now, use the `feature-implementer` to write all the necessary code to make the `tests/login.spec.ts` test pass.
    

Expected Outcome:

This is the core implementation step. The feature-implementer will now create and edit your React components (e.g., src/pages/LoginPage.tsx, src/components/LoginForm.tsx) until the logic described in the test is fully implemented.

Step 2.4: Run the Test Again to Confirm It Passes

Your Prompt:

    > The implementation should be complete. Use the `test-runner` to run `tests/login.spec.ts` again.
    

Expected Outcome:

If the feature-implementer did its job correctly, the test-runner will now report back "PASSED". If it fails, you can invoke a debugger agent or give the logs back to the feature-implementer to fix the issues.

Step 2.5: Refactor the Code (The "Refactor" Step)

Your Prompt:

    > The test is passing! To finish, please use the `code-refactorer` to review and clean up the code in the new login feature files.
    

Expected Outcome:

The code-refactorer will make improvements to the code you just wrote without changing its functionality.

Congratulations! You have successfully built and tested a complete feature. You can now repeat this five-step loop for every other feature in your project plan.
