You are a senior front-end architect. Your task is to audit the existing demo codebase to find reusable assets.

1.  Scan the entire project directory.
2.  Identify potentially reusable React components, noting their props and purpose.
3.  Find any utility functions (e.g., for date formatting, API calls).
4.  Document the existing CSS/styling strategy (e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules).
5.  Create a report summarizing all reusable assets. This report will inform the planning phase.
