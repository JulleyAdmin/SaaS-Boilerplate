## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Set up the healthcare foundation
2. **Prioritize compliance features** - Critical for healthcare
3. **Build MVP with core modules** - Patient, appointments, billing
4. **Get pilot hospitals** - 2-3 SME hospitals for feedback
5. **Iterate based on feedback** - Healthcare users have specific needs
6. **Scale gradually** - Add advanced features based on demand

Remember: Healthcare software requires extra attention to security, compliance, and reliability. Always validate features with actual hospital staff before full deployment.
