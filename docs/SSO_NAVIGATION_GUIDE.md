# üß≠ SSO Management Navigation Guide

## üéØ **How to Find SSO Management**

The SSO management interface is integrated with Clerk's Organization Profile component. Here's how to access it:

---

## üîç **Step-by-Step Navigation**

### **Method 1: Through Organization Profile (Primary)**

1. **Login** to http://localhost:3001
   - Email: admin@stmarys.hospital.com
   - Password: u3Me65zO&8@b

2. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Should automatically redirect after login
   - URL will be something like: `/dashboard`

3. **Access Organization Profile**
   - Look for "Organization" or "Settings" in the navigation
   - Or try direct URL: `/dashboard/organization-profile`
   - This opens Clerk's Organization Profile interface

4. **Find SSO/Security Tab**
   - Within Organization Profile, look for:
     - "Security" tab
     - "SSO" tab
     - "Authentication" tab
     - "Connections" tab

### **Method 2: Direct URL Access**

Try these URLs directly:

1. **Primary SSO Page**: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile/sso
2. **Organization Profile**: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile
3. **Localized Version**: http://localhost:3001/en/dashboard/organization-profile

## üîß **If SSO Options Still Not Visible**

### **Check 1: Verify Organization Context**
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Look for organization ID in network requests
# Verify you're in "St. Mary's General Hospital" organization
```

### **Check 2: User Permissions**
- Ensure user has **Admin** or **Owner** role
- SSO management requires elevated permissions
- Check user role in Clerk dashboard

### **Check 3: Clerk Configuration**
- Verify organization exists: "St. Mary's General Hospital"
- Check if SSO features are enabled in Clerk
- Confirm organization settings allow SSO management

---

## üöÄ **Alternative: Create Custom SSO Navigation**

If Clerk's interface doesn't show SSO options, let's add our own navigation:

### **Quick Fix: Add SSO Menu Item**

1. **Check Current Dashboard Layout**
   - Look for navigation menu in dashboard
   - Find where "Organization Profile" link exists

2. **Add SSO Link**
   - Add direct link to our SSO management page
   - URL: `/dashboard/organization-profile/sso`

3. **Test Custom SSO Page**
   - Access: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile/sso
   - This should show our `SSOConnectionList` component

---

## üß™ **Testing Current SSO Components**

### **Direct Component Test**

Try accessing our SSO page directly:

**URL**: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile/sso

**Expected**:
- Page with SSO connection management interface
- "Create SSO Connection" button
- List of existing connections (initially empty)

### **Debug Steps**

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check network requests

2. **Verify Component Loading**
   - Confirm `SSOConnectionList` component renders
   - Check if API calls are working
   - Look for any permission errors

---

## üéØ **Expected UI Elements**

When you find the SSO management interface, you should see:

### **SSO Connection List**
- Table/list of existing SSO connections
- "Create New Connection" button
- Edit/Delete actions for each connection

### **Create Connection Form**
- Name field
- Description field
- Metadata URL field
- Tenant/Organization field
- Redirect URL field

### **Hospital Context**
- Organization name: "St. Mary's General Hospital"
- Hospital-specific terminology
- Role-based access controls

---

## üìû **Current Testing Approach**

### **Option A: Use Direct URL**
```
http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile/sso
```

### **Option B: Check Clerk Organization Profile**
```
http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile
```
Look for SSO/Security tabs within Clerk's interface

### **Option C: Add Custom Navigation**
If neither works, we can quickly add a direct navigation link

---

## üîß **Quick Status Check**

**Try this right now**:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/organization-profile/sso
2. Does the page load?
3. Do you see SSO management interface?
4. Any errors in browser console?

**Report back what you see, and I'll help guide you to the SSO management interface!**

## üí° **Next Steps Based on What You See**

### ‚úÖ **If SSO page loads directly**

- Follow the testing plan

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **If page shows error/404**
- We'll add proper navigation
- Check routing configuration

### üîç **If page loads but empty**
- Check user permissions
- Verify organization context
- Debug component loading
