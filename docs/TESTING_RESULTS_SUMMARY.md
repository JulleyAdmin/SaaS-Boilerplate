## 🔧 Database Schema Updates

### New Tables Added:
1. **api_keys** - Secure API key storage with hashing
2. **team_members** - Team membership with roles
3. **invitations** - Team invitation system with tokens

### Existing Schema:
- All tables properly indexed
- Foreign key constraints in place
- Proper enum types for roles and actions

## 🎯 Testing Status

### ✅ Completed:
- Database schema validation
- Component creation and integration
- API endpoint implementation
- UI component development
- Route configuration
- TypeScript compilation (core features)

### 🔄 In Progress:
- Manual browser testing
- User flow validation
- Integration testing

### ⏭️ Next Steps:
1. **Manual Testing** using the testing guide at `scripts/manual-testing-guide.md`
2. **Fix remaining TypeScript issues** in SSO integration (non-blocking)
3. **Integration testing** of all features together
4. **Webhook Management** implementation (next major feature)

## 🌐 Available Testing Routes

With the dev server running (`npm run dev`), test these routes:

| Route | Feature | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/dashboard/api-keys` | API Key Mgmt | Create, list, delete API keys |
| `/dashboard/security` | MFA Settings | Enable/disable MFA, backup codes |
| `/dashboard/team` | Team Mgmt | Invite members, manage roles |
| `/invitations/accept?token=xxx` | Invitation | Accept team invitations |

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture Patterns Used:
- **React Hook Form** + **Zod** for form validation
- **SWR** for data fetching and caching
- **Clerk** for authentication and MFA
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations
- **Radix UI** for accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

### Security Considerations:
- API keys hashed with SHA-256
- One-time display of sensitive data
- Role-based access control
- Secure token generation for invitations
- Proper organization scoping

### Code Quality:
- TypeScript strict mode
- Proper error handling
- Loading states and user feedback
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Some non-critical TS errors in SSO integration files (not affecting new features)
2. **Build Warnings**: TypeORM dependency warnings (from Jackson SAML) - not critical
3. **Lint Issues**: Minor documentation formatting issues

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Before moving to next features:

- [ ] Test API key creation and management
- [ ] Test MFA setup and configuration  
- [ ] Test team member invitations (email + link)
- [ ] Test role management and permissions
- [ ] Test invitation acceptance flow
- [ ] Verify data persistence across sessions
- [ ] Check error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Validate proper organization scoping

## 🎉 Success Metrics

The implementation is considered successful when:
- ✅ All UI components render without errors
- ✅ Database operations complete successfully  
- ✅ API endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Role-based access control works
- ✅ Data persists across browser sessions
- ✅ Security measures are properly implemented

**Ready for Testing!** 🚀

The development server should be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Use the manual testing guide to validate all functionality before proceeding to webhook management implementation.
